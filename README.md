# Cloud-Computing-Project
This repository provides my project for the 8th Eagle gen cloud computing course in GEE. 

The project idea was to map deforestation and afforestation using a random forest classification in the Sebangau Nationalpark, Kalimantan, Borneo and to inspect accuracy differences when adding indices- and SAR data to the optical bands. 

Landsat8 scenes were processed for optical information and used to compute ndvi and ndwi information, while Sentinel2 scenes were deployed for radar (VV/VH) information. 
The random forest function written allosÂ´s to loop over different sets of bands serving as input for the classification and thus, allows to inspect changes in the implemented accuracy assessment in order to find the most suitable set of bands for the classification.  
The resulting landcover(-change) maps are complemented with a legend, a calculation of the area of the respective landcover classes in sqkm and a yearly timeline of the mean ndvi value of the area for the years 2015 to 2023. 

The code can easily be modified to inspect different areas, sets of bands or years of interest.
